#### 1.1 What is Tailwind CSS?

- **Tailwind** is a CSS framework that uses low-level 'utility' classes to create layouts. **This is known a utility-first framework**.
- Traditional CSS frameworks like Bootstrap use classes that are directly correlated to components (eg Alerts, Navbars). Tailwind uses classes as utilities to put together to build your own custom components.

</div>
```
